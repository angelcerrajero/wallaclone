# FINAL CHALLENGE FULLSTACK WEB DEVELOPMENT BOOTCAMP VII EDITION

## NodeJS - Express - MongoDB - REACT - REDUX


## Introduction

Wallaclone is an SPA APP created with Node and Express on the Back-end (API REST) and React on the Front-end.

This app is design for connect people who wants to sell & buy specific products on a simple, quick and safe way.

Wallaclone is a responsive app which can be used on any device and also secure because we implement the last security methods such as JWT for encode all information betweet the client and server.

The users could filter information by name, tags, price, and ads type (selling or buying). If you create an account you could upload your own products, edit them and delete when you've selled or buyed it.
